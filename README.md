# Java-Game
My project at the end of semester,some function isn't wonderful.
And although the semester is end, but this game maybe could continue to be better then.
If you have passion to do with it, and you have the basical knowledge of Java(Web,GUI and data-base specifially),I'm sure I have need of your help.

## Disadvantages

### The end of game
This game couldn't judge the winning of game and ending game automatically.

### The sign of game
There is a false logic here that the signing process is judged at Client.class, but it should be judged at Server.class undoubtedly that the Client should submit the information to the Server and judged then.

## Attention
If you do want to do some help for this project, you'd better look at these points:
### This Project Is A Maven Project
### The Sign Is Through SHA-1 Encrypt And Excel(.xlsx) Reader
### The Correspondence Is Through DES Encrypt And Decrypt
